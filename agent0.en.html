					<h2>Company history</h2>
					<p>
						Moment0 was founded 20 years ago by Miss Karina Reiter, Marc Hennemann, David Reyinger, Michael Vitzhum and Christopher Walker. In their first years they concentrated on
						the Production of highquality Bluetooth-Headphones. After some Products were successfully established, the founders decided to research new product capabilities. After time
						went by the company developed a revolutionary In-Ear-Headphone which is able to connect to several devices with Bluetooth. After a lot of intense and thoughtful discussions
						between the entrepreneurs and some investors the company lead decided to dedicate completely on this new way of listening to music. Due to the reorganization Karina Reiter
						and Christopher Walker two of the founders had to leave the company.
						Nonetheless the support of investors helped the company to build one of the most modern productcentres in Germany. So far the company is able to produce 20 headphones per
						day which is not only a indicator of exclusivity more a perfect  procedure from the 50 employees.
